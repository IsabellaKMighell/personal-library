      "description": "The sourcing and recruitment community has come a long way from what it used to be 20 years back and as recently as 5 years back and the amount of technology changes has kept everyone on the tenterhooks. The methods that you would adopt or Boolean strings that used to work today may not work tomorrow and there is a constant learning curve to keep oneself updated and also brings a healthy level of competition among individuals eager to show their wares. The volume based or niche skills hiring has become a race to the finish. The individuals with the super sourcing as well as relationship management skills tend to be more often than not the winners in the end. The recruitment community looks to find the needle in the haystack every day to find the right candidate to fulfill the hiring manager mandate. The ever bulging stock of search strings, productivity tricks and their ways of thinking they implement are a stuff of legend. The tools do not make a Sourcer or recruiter but they should always be seen as an assistant to free up their time for more productive conversations with prospective candidates. This exercise is an attempt to equip the Talent Acquisition community with the various ways and methods to optimize their time and find the relevant information (trends, movers and shakers etc.) to be better prepared to find relevant candidates for their clients (internal or external). It is by no means an exhaustive list but a start nonetheless.",
